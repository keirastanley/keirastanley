## âœ¨ Keira Stanley

Hi, I'm Keira. I'm a junior software developer with a solid understanding of JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Express. 

Before getting into coding I studied languages and translation and worked as a language teacher in Spain for 4 years. 

In my free time I make music and art.
