### ‚ú® Keira Stanley

_Full-stack development student @ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/school-of-code/">School of Code</a>_

üëã Hi, I'm Keira.

The journey that led me to coding began with learning to play the piano and read sheet music as a child, learning Spanish and the fundamentals of translation at university, discovering a love of chess in my early 20s and piecing together the common threads that run through all these interests: pattern recognition, analytical thinking and problem-solving.

I gave <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">CS50</a> a go in early 2022. After continuing for a few months in my spare time to be sure my enjoyment wasn't a fluke I decided to take a career change seriously, which led to me finding School of Code where I'll be studying full-stack development until February 2023.

So far I've learned how to use JavaScript, Node.js, Express and SQL for backend, HTML, CSS and React for front-end, Jest and Cypress for testing as well as tools such as Figma and Miro for planning and design.

<!--The project will be completed in 3 steps:
1. Static webpage made with React with only basic functionality (e.g. dropdown nav, buttons change colour on click). All data stored in arrays.
2. All user-generated data (e.g. things to do, goals) stored locally in JSON files. Poetry and art from free APIs.
3. All user-generated data moved to databases to allow for persistent changes to content.-->
