ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Keira.

The journey that led me to coding began with learning to play the piano and read sheet music as a child, learning Spanish and the fundamentals of translation at university, discovering a love of chess in my early 20s and piecing together the common threads that run through all these interests: pattern recognition, analytical thinking and problem-solving.

I gave <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">CS50</a> a go on a whim in early 2022 and when I completed <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/1/"> my first problem set</a> in C, I found the cyclical process of initially feeling totally stuck but always eventually finding a solution to be strangely engrossing. 

After continuing for a few months in my spare time to be sure my enjoyment wasn't a fluke I decided to take a career change seriously, which led to me finding School of Code where I'll be studying full-stack development until February 2023.

So far I've learned how to use JavaScript, Node.js, Express and SQL for backend, HTML, CSS and React for front-end, Jest and Cypress for testing as well as tools such as Figma and Miro for planning and design.
